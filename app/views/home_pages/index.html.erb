		What We Do
	</h1>
	<p>
		So you are not ill, but how “well” are you?  
		The degree of wellness can be measured.  
		Measuring Wellness offers a proprietary analysis of basic 
			laboratory blood chemistry that uncovers subtle imbalances in your health.  
		Your metabolism is a sophisticated equilibrium that operates optimally 
			when your blood chemistry is maintained within narrow ranges.  
			When blood chemistries deviate from these narrow ranges 
				“subclinical defects” may emerge.  
		We call them “subclinical” because they are not clinically 
			recognized by standard western medicine parameters to be defective.  
		The symptoms of these imbalances are initially subtle best described 
			by feeling suboptimal.  
		However, if left untreated the subclinical defects can progress 
			into full-blown illness.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Recognizing that your body and its metabolism are like a finely tuned 
				performance sports car is the first big step toward wellness.  
			You will have the best performance and longevity with the correct maintenance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Measuring Wellness starts with you having blood drawn at your local laboratory.  
			The laboratory performs a custom analysis on your blood.  
			Measuring Wellness receives the results from the laboratory and 
				performs the proprietary analysis.  
			An individualed treatment plan, based on your analysis, 
				is developed specifically for you.  
			You then follow the customized protocol -- which may include
				dietary, lifestyle, and nutrient supplementation guidance --
				and your health improves. 
			You feel better!

		What We Measure
	</h1>
	
	<%
		# Initialize content
		ph_image_path = "ph_balance.jpg"
		ph_content = <<-eof
			The body works very, very hard to regulate its acidity. 
			Acid is measured and discussed in terms of pH. 
			The ideal pH of the body has been scientifically determined to be 7.4. 
			The body works to maintain itself as close to that level as possible. 
			Your internal chemistry is based on this concept of pH blalance 
				and its ideal level. 
			Acid is controlled by compounds that are alkaline. 
			The process is called buffering and we measure your bodies pH and whether
				or not it is struggling to maintain this important balance.
		eof

		aerobic_image_path = "aerobic_metabolism.jpg"
		aerobic_content = <<-eof
			The body prefers to make energy using oxygen. 
			This is called Aerobic Metabolism.  
			This is most efficient method of creating energy from foods. 
			You get a much higher return (you make MORE energy) 
				when things are done aerobically. 
			However, the body has the capacity to make energy without oxygen. 
			This is called Anaerobic Metabolism. 
			It is much less efficient. 
			Anaerobic metabolism is in the neighborhood of 
				5 to 6 times less efficient than aerobic metabolism. 
			As an analogy, would you rather make $35 or $5 on an investment? 
			For the body it's a ‘no brainer'.														
		eof

		calcium_phosphate_image_path = "calcium_phosphate_balance.jpg"
		calcium_phosphate_content = <<-eof
			Calcium balance is absolutely crucial for your health and wellness. 
			Calcium is the only mineral that has its very own glandular 
				system devoted to maintaining its balance -- the parathyroid glands. 
			Why is the balance of calcium so important? 
			We mostly think of calcium in terms of bone loss as we age 
				and with arthritis or coronary artery calcification. 
			Yet, every muscle contraction and every nerve impulse in your 
				body depends totally on the proper calcium physiology.
			We measure the ratio of these two critical elements and look for 
				evidence of your body struggling to maintain a healthy balance.
		eof

		protein_image_path = "protein_metabolism.jpg"
		protein_content = <<-eof
			Your body is literally held together by a web of protein.  
			Proteins are constructed from amino acids.  
			The supply of amino acids in the body is tightly regulated and monitored.  
			Your body demands that you have a certain level of amino acids available 
				for the synthesis of new proteins.  
			Amino acids come from two sources: diet, and the recycling of 
				worn out proteins in the body.
			Protein levels (and whether or not your body is absorbing the amino acids
				it has available to it) can be measured.
		eof

		inflammation_image_path = "inflammation.jpg"
		inflammation_content = <<-eof
			Inflammation is often viewed just as a "bad thing".
			Not necessarily.
			Inflammation is above all a health maintenance process. 
			Its study occupies the whole area of medicine known as immunology. 
			It cannot be measured directly by a single specific laboratory test, 
				but is viewed through many different parameters -- 
				much like looking at the US economy through various economic indicators. 
			The higher the levels of the various inflammation indicators, 
				the more the body struggles to maintain control. 
			There are 14 parameters of inflammation we measure, 
				and they must be looked at as a package.
		eof

		connective_tissue_image_path = "connective_tissue_integrity.jpg"
		connective_tissue_content = <<-eof
			Connective tissues literally connect the body together. 
			You can see healthy connective tissue reflects in smooth skin, 
				strong muscles and bones, 
				and healthy amounts of cartilage in joints. 
			It is often an unappreciated property of youth and, 
				is not fully appreciated until it is gone. 
			Healthy connective tissue is the focus of much, if not most, 
				of the “anti-aging” health promotion. 
			Plastic surgery, joint replacements, and literally hundreds of 
				magic creams all promise the hope of the vibrant return of 
				healthy connective tissue. 
			As usual in most things health-related, 
				an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
		eof

		oxidative_stress_image_path = "oxidative_stress.jpg"
		oxidative_stress_content = <<-eof
			Oxidative Stress can be likened to ‘biological rusting’. 
			Oxidative stress is a part of life -- all life. 
			It is the process that causes us to age. 
			It involves one molecule taking an electron (oxidation) from another molecule. 
			It happens literally billions of times every second in your body. 
			When a molecule loses one of its electrons, 
				this changes the chemistry and shape of the molecule, 
				and therefore can alter its function. 
			How does our body deal with this?
			Our analysis can "see" how your body deals with this stress.
